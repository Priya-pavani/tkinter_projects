# tkinter_projects
All python projects using tkinter will be available here.
my first git hub repository.
This code is all about tkinter which is a gui application of python.
Tkinter is one of the easiest gui applications.
Here in this repository I want to show all the applications which I have build using python and python tkinter module

So, here are the list of projects that I have build :

	1)Image viewer app using tkinter

	2)Opening desired image (it is not a project but just an exercise to open desired files in our tkinter window)

  	3) Database app ( If you are running the program for the first time then you must takeout the comment that creates the table in the data base
   			  after running it one time you can comment it out for further interpretations.)

 	4) Weather app (coming soon..........................................................)
